  will constain code for methods related to the behavior of the vehicle
  like some kind of rules, for e.g.:
  Given vehicle i, and two vehicles i-1 (behind i) and i+1 (ahead of i)
  and dt = d(i,i+1) the distance between i and i+1 as perceived by i at t, i will behave according to dt

The key idea is that every movement is determined by behavioral rules, which are imposed by social influences,
rational decisions or actions following a stimulus-reaction process. These rules can be modeled as attractive
or repulsive forces. In the case of vehicular mobility, the next intersection towards the trip destination
wields an attractive force on the vehicle, whereas other vehicles or obstacles in general exert a repulsive
force on it. The result from the composition of these forces determines the acceleration vector which drives
the car movement. An example of force-composing model is illustrated in Figure V. However, this model is
especially expensive under the computational point of view, as every movement require the elaboration and
composition of multiple inter-object forces.
